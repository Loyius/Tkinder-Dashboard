# Tkinter Designer - Recreated for Learning Purposes  

This repository is a recreation of [ParthJadhav's Tkinter Designer](https://github.com/ParthJadhav/Tkinter-Designer) project. I decided to recreate it as a study guide to deepen my understanding of GUI development with Tkinter and how it integrates with tools like Figma.  

## About the Original Project  

The original project by Parth Jadhav is a fantastic tool that allows developers to create modern, visually appealing Tkinter GUIs by directly importing Figma designs. It simplifies the process of building complex Tkinter interfaces and bridges the gap between design and development.  

**To be able to run the dashboard go to the folder "build" and run the file: "gui.py"**

## Purpose of This Repository  

The main purpose of this repository is to serve as a learning resource. By recreating the project in order to:  
- Understand how to work with Tkinter for building Python-based GUIs.  
- Learn how to interact with APIs like Figmaâ€™s.  
- Explore the design-to-development workflow in greater depth.  
- Improve Python programming and problem-solving skills.  

## Features of the Original Project  

- Import designs directly from Figma into a Tkinter application
- Support for modern UI components and layouts
- Automation of repetitive coding tasks in Tkinter

## Acknowledgments  

Big thanks to [Parth Jadhav](https://github.com/ParthJadhav) for creating the original project. It serves as both an inspiration and a great learning tool for developers exploring GUI development with Tkinter.
